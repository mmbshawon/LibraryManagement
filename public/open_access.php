		                        		<h4>Why Open Access?</h4>
		                        		<p>The move towards Open Access is motivated by two things; increasing access to published research and the new policies established by HEFCE and other funders, including RCUK and The Wellcome Trust.<br>
		                        		This service is designed to help you comply with your funders' Open Access policies and ensure your work is eligible for the REF.</p>
		                        		<h4>Benefits of Open Access</h4>
		                        		<p>Open Access removes restrictions to view and read a work and allows reuse, redistribution and modification of the work with attribution.<br>
		                        		For the author and researcher, Open Access enables them to raise the visibility and profile of their research and to increase its impact.<br>
		                        		It also increases access to research, widening the spread of knowledge and ideas.</p>
		                        		<h4>Open Access publishing</h4>
		                        		<p>There are two main models for Open Access; self-archiving versus pay to publish.<br><br>
		                        		<b>1. Self-archiving (Green Open Access)</b><br><br>
		                        		The deposit of peer-reviewed manuscripts in an Open Access repository. Publishers often stipulate a fixed period of time before the article can be made freely available (an embargo).<br><br>
		                        		What does self-archiving mean for you?<br><br>
		                        		*** An increase in the availability and visibility of your work<br>
		                        		*** It removes the need to pay Open Access charges<br><br>
		                        		The University prefers the self-archiving model. Find out more about uploading your manuscript.<br><br>
		                        		<b>Embargo</b><br><br>
		                        		The embargo is a fixed period of time a publisher might establish to delay the Open Access publication of a manuscript. These embargo periods may differ in length from 6 - 36 months and vary in subject fields. This will affect when your manuscript will be able to be viewed and accessed. We can help you find out how a publisher’s embargo might affect you.<br><br>
		                        		<b>2. Pay to publish (Gold Open Access)</b><br><br>
		                        		Free access to the final published versions of articles, immediately on publication. The publisher requires an Article Processing Charge which includes Open Access charges.<br><br>
		                        		What does this mean for you?<br><br>
		                        		*** Provides immediate access to journals as soon as they are published<br>
		                        		*** Meets the requirement of certain funders.<br><br>
		                        		The University and funders may help in the payment of this. Find out more</p>
		                        		<h4>Open Access at the University of UU</h4>
		                        		<p>The University of UU has an Open Access policy and Open Access Project Board , who are responsible for responding to HEFCE and funder Open Access policy changes and establishing this service.</p>

										<h4>Who is affected</h4>
										<p>Every Cambridge author who is submitting their work in the next REF, and only for articles or conference proceedings (with an ISSN).</p>
										<h4>Which manuscripts to upload</h4>
										<p>Upload articles or conference proceedings (with an ISSN). Monographs, books and other book chapters do not need to be uploaded.</p>
										<h4>Who can upload manuscripts</h4>
										<p>Manuscripts can be uploaded by an author, or an administrator or librarian on their behalf. You will need a Raven account (CRSid) to upload a manuscript.<br><br>
										Each co-author should upload their accepted manuscripts. We will detect duplicates after papers have been uploaded.</p>
										<h4>Which version to upload</h4>
										<p>You should upload your Author’s Accepted Manuscript. This is your version of the manuscript after peer review and including any final changes, but before publisher typesetting or copy-editing by the publisher.<br><br>
										Please do not send final versions, or typeset proofs.<br><br>
										You should upload the manuscript before you sign the publisher’s Copyright Transfer Agreement. Find out more about your copyright options.</p>
										<h4>When you need to upload</h4>
										<p>As soon as your peer-reviewed manuscript has been accepted, upload it. HEFCE policy requires manuscripts to be uploaded no later than three months after acceptance.<br><br>
										Ideally you should upload the manuscript, or contact us, before signing a Copyright Transfer Agreement or choosing an Open Access option on the journal website.</p>
										<h4>Your copyright options</h4>
										<p>Your rights will vary depending on your publisher. Many Copyright Transfer Agreements already allow you to comply with HEFCE and some other funders’ Open Access policies.<br><br>
										Publishers may choose to licence back some rights in your work e.g. for use in teaching or to promote your research. You may prefer to retain your rights, rather than give them to the publisher and try to get them back later.<br><br>
										You have two copyright options;<br>
										<b>1. Sign a Copyright Transfer Agreement</b><br><br>
										A Copyright Transfer Agreement (CTA) may give your publisher copyright and might affect how and when you can make your manuscript Open Access.<br>
										We’ll check your publisher’s model for licensing and Open Access when you upload your manuscript.<br><br>
										<b>2. Use a Scholar’s Addendum</b><br>
										The University of Cambridge Scholars' Addendum enables you to change the traditional agreement you have with your publisher. You still transfer copyright, but include a proviso covering digital usage and access.<br>
										How to use the Addendum:<br>
										Download the Cambridge Scholars' Addendum.<br>
										Print the Addendum and add the manuscript and journal titles, corresponding author and publisher names.<br>
										Date and sign the agreement.<br>
										Scan and email the agreement to the publisher. Ask them to sign and append it to their Copyright Transfer Agreement.<br>
										If you need advice and guidance on how to approach your publisher and use the Addendum with your existing agreement, please contact us.<br>
										There are alternative Addendums available here .<br>
										I’ve already signed an agreement<br><br>
										If you can, it’s better to contact us before you sign an agreement. If you’ve already signed we can check whether the agreement allows you to comply with HEFCE and your other funders’ Open Access policies.<br>
										If it doesn’t comply, we can liaise with your publisher and help you negotiate amended rights. If you need advice and guidance please contact us.</p>
										<h4>Licences</h4>
										<p>Licences are used to tell the reader what rights they are being given in relation to the paper/article when they access it. Different publishers offer a range of licensing agreements. Licences affect how your work can be copied, distributed, shared and how others can use it, commercially and non-commercially.<br>
										Some funders (e.g. RCUK, Wellcome Trust) specify what licence Open Access content should be published under. If this applies to your article, we'll check whether your journal offers the right licence and advise you if you need to take any further action.</p>

			                    		<p>HEFCE has a new policy for Open Access in the next Research Excellence Framework (REF).<br>
			                    		The policy requires you to submit your accepted, peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings to an institutional or subject repository.<br><br>
			                    		We will continue to advise on other funders' policies and to pay eligible Open Access costs for papers funded by Research Councils UK (RCUK) and The Charity Open Access Fund, which includes the Wellcome Trust.<br><br>
			                    		Upload your accepted manuscripts and we’ll make sure your work is eligible for the next REF, and guide you through how to comply with other funder requirements.</p>

										<h4>What type of manuscripts are affected?</h4>
										<p>All accepted journal articles and conference proceedings (with an ISSN) should be uploaded, to ensure they are eligible for the next REF.<br><br>
										This policy does not apply to monographs, book chapters or other long-form publications, working papers, creative or practice-based research outputs or data.</p>
										<h4>When do I need to do something?</h4>
										<p>As soon as your peer-reviewed manuscript has been accepted, upload it. HEFCE policy requires manuscripts to be submitted within 3 months of the acceptance date.<br><br>
										This policy comes into force on 1 April 2016, yet we want to ensure this shift is managed sooner rather than later, so that no research is omitted.<br><br>
										Uploading at acceptance lets us check your options and advise you how to fill in copyright or Open Access forms to comply with other funders’ requirements, and – in eligible cases – to commit funds to cover Open Access fees.</p>
										<h4>Research Excellence Framework (REF)</h4>
										<p>By uploading your peer-reviewed manuscript as soon as it is accepted by a publisher, we’ll make sure you comply with HEFCE’s Open Access policy for the next REF and deposit it in the institutional repository.<br><br>
										Publisher embargoes are respected (the period when you can only access an article with a paid access). Manuscripts must be free to read and download after the following periods:<br><br>
										12 months for REF Main Panel A and REF Main Panel B<br>
										24 months for REF Main Panel C and REF Main Panel D7</p>
										<h4>How does this apply to other funders?</h4>
										<p>In addition to the HEFCE policy, other funders’ Open Access policies may apply to your manuscript.<br><br>
										When you upload your manuscript we'll check which policies apply and guide you through how to make it compliant.<br><br>
										The University manages two Open Access funds:<br>
										The Charity Open Access Fund (includes Wellcome Trust)<br>
										Research Councils UK<br>
										We can pay Open Access charges for eligible articles, from these funds.</p>
