		                                In a time of rapid change, Cornell University Library continues to stand at the center of intellectual life on campus. With world-class collections and services — print, online, and in person — our Library serves as an indispensable partner in study, teaching, and research at the university.<br><br>
		                                Cornell’s graduating seniors consistently rank the Library as the No. 1 service on campus, and students credit the Library with saving their GPAs and keeping their dissertations on track. Faculty members rank the Library as a leading indicator of work-life satisfaction and credit our holdings with creative breakthroughs in research.<br><br>
		                                Our staff engages with faculty and researchers in cutting-edge initiatives to develop infrastructure to support e-science and data curation and protect fair use and intellectual property rights. The Library also works to help faculty members incorporate information competency skills into their curricula and enable the networking of researchers across all disciplines at Cornell and beyond. At the same time, the Library serves as a steward of wonderful treasures ranging from clay tablets to Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address to original research materials on hip hop to the most important online repository in the world, arXiv.org.<br><br>
		                                Our librarians are subject area experts who provide outstanding services to researchers, emphasizing speed, convenience, and enhanced productivity. They also engage with foundations, corporations, and other research libraries to preserve cultural-heritage treasures from around the world and spearhead initiatives to provide researchers in the world’s poorest countries with access to top agricultural journals.<br><br>
		                                I invite you to learn more about this wonderful Library by exploring our Web site and visiting our Library in person.<br><br>

      								<p>The Library keeps evolving. In recent years we have been given the magnificent Montaigne Library of Gilbert de Botton, the literary archive of Dame Margaret Drabble, and the Chadwyck-Healey Liberation Collection, the definitive collection of French books published following the German retreat from French soil on 25 August 1944, donated by Sir Charles Chadwyck-Healey. Our major purchases have included the archive of the war poet Siegfried Sassoon and the important manuscript of St Luke’s Gospel known as the ‘Codex Zacynthius’, both supported with grants from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Friends of the National Libraries. A ground-breaking collaboration with the Bodleian Libraries also saw the Library jointly acquire the Lewis-Gibson Collection of Hebrew and Arabic manuscripts from the Cairo Genizah, collected by the twin Scottish sisters Agnes Lewis and Margaret Gibson.</p>
