						<h4>First steps</h4>
						<p>There are many decisions to make about managing your data before you even start creating/collecting it. These include formal or semi-formal data planning (many funders now require data management plans to be submitted with grant applications), choosing hardware and software, and addressing issues related to intellectual property rights and ethics. Decisions made at the beginning (or as early as possible) will affect how you can access, use, or preserve your data in the future. Your best starting point is to create a data management plan - whether your funder requires you to prepare one or not. A proper data management could be a useful resource to you as a guidance map to all your research datasets. You might also wish to keep your data management plan up to date in case your funder has any questions about your data sharing activities.<br><br>
						Additionally, creating a data management plan will also help you to highlight any regulatory issues that you might need to consider before even starting to collect your data. For example, if you intend to conduct interviews, have you asked your interviewees for a permission to record and re-use collected information?  A proper data management plan created at the beginning of the project, can save you a lot of time during data collection, and also when consolidating your data towards the end of the project.<br><br>

						<h4>Organising your data</h4>
						<p>Once you create, gather, or start manipulating data and files, they can quickly become disorganised. To save time and prevent errors later on, you and your colleagues should decide how you will name and structure files and folders. Including documentation (or 'metadata') will allow you to add context to your data so that you and others can understand it in the short, medium, and long-term.<br><br>
						Below you can find some guidance on:<br><br>
						<a href="#">Naming and Organising Files</a><br><br>
						<a href="#">Documentation and Metadata</a><br><br>
						<a href="#">Managing References</a><br><br>
						<a href="#">Organising E-mail</a></p>
						<h4>Naming and Organising files</h4>
						<p>Choosing a logical and consistent way to name and organise your files allows you and others to easily locate and use them. Ideally, the best time to think how to name and structure the documents and directories you create is at the start of a project.<br><br>
						Agreeing on a naming convention will help to provide consistency, which will make it easier to find and correctly identify your files, prevent version control problems when working on files collaboratively. Organising your files carefully will save you time and frustration by helping you and your colleagues find what you need when you need it.</p>

						<h4>Aspects you should consider when thinking about the access to your data</h4>
						<p>Few researchers always work in the same location, so you will need remote access to your data. You will probably also be sharing files with others, either as part of a project or through routine information-sharing with colleagues. In addition to accessing your own data, you may want to access existing sources of data.<br><br>
						Once you finish your project, you should also preserve and share your own data with your research community through a digital repository or data centre (which may garner data citations).<br><br>

						<h4>Sharing</h4>
						<p>How can I make it easier for others to re-use the materials that I produce?<br><br>
						One relatively simple way to make it easier for others to re-use tools, data, or other content that you produce is to add a Creative Commons license. For example ‘By-Attribution, Non-Commercial’ is a common Creative Commons license – when you mark your file, image, or information with this, it means that anyone can use your information in any way they like, so long as they attribute it to you and don’t use it for commercial purposes. There are other types of Creative Commons licenses, also allowing commerical use, and licesnse which do not require re-user to attribute the creator. Creative Commons licenses are often used for materials released online, but you can also include these in printed materials if your publisher does not own the rights. For additional information about Creative Commons license options, visit their website or watch the short video below:<br><br>
						To license something with a Creative Commons license, you don't need to file any paperwork - just publish (in print or on the web) your materials along with a notification that you are using a particular license.<br><br>
						<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Creative Commons licenses are 'irrevocable' so do not add a Creative Commons license unless you are sure that:<br><br>
						you have the right to publish this information<br><br>
						you will not want to revoke it later on for any reason.</p>
